## Model Providers

This template uses the [Vercel AI Gateway](https://vercel.com/docs/ai-gateway) to access multiple AI models through a unified interface. The default configuration includes [xAI](https://x.ai) models (`grok-2-vision-1212`, `grok-3-mini`) routed through the gateway.

### AI Gateway Authentication

**For Vercel deployments**: Authentication is handled automatically via OIDC tokens.

**For non-Vercel deployments**: You need to provide an AI Gateway API key by setting the `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY` environment variable in your `.env.local` file.

With the [AI SDK](https://ai-sdk.dev/docs/introduction), you can also switch to direct LLM providers like [OpenAI](https://openai.com), [Anthropic](https://anthropic.com), [Cohere](https://cohere.com/), and [many more](https://ai-sdk.dev/providers/ai-sdk-providers) with just a few lines of code.

## Running locally

Atlas consists of both a Next.js frontend and a Python FastAPI backend. You'll need to set up environment variables for both components.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and pnpm
- Python 3.8+
- OpenAI API key

### Environment Setup

1. **Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory**
2. **Install Vercel CLI:** `npm i -g vercel`
3. **Link with Vercel:** `vercel link` (creates `.vercel` directory)
4. **Download environment variables:** `vercel env pull`

### Frontend Setup (Next.js)

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start the frontend (includes backend via concurrently)
pnpm dev
```

### Backend Setup (Python FastAPI)

If you need to run the backend separately:

```bash
# Navigate to backend directory
cd backend

# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set environment variables
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here

# Run the backend server
uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000
```

### Full Development Environment

For the complete development experience with both frontend and backend:

```bash
# This runs both frontend (port 3000) and backend (port 8000)
pnpm dev
```

Your Atlas application will be available at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

> **Security Note:** Never commit your `.env` file or expose your OpenAI API key in version control.
